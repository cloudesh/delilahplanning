### A personal statement from Delilah
*A wedding ceremony is such a stunning and beautiful event, ever since I first helped my sister coordinate her wedding two years ago, I have been in love with helping both imagine and design the perfect day. I founded Delilah Planning out of a genuine love for being able to make the dreams and imagination of beautiful couples come true.*

*Sometimes the thought of such an important, special day can be overwhelming. And that's what we're here for. You might only want a light-touch of some of the details or a guiding hand to help you through each step of the way. Or perhaps you want to relax with the reassurance that everything is being handled, no matter how much (or little) support you need from us, from me—we're here for you.*

Sincerely,

### What does Delilah Planning offer?
*When you reach out to us, we'll arrange a consultation where we'll go over what your expectations are. We'll go through every single small detail of what goes into a wedding ceremony, and you'll decide which parts you want us to handle. Perhaps you'll want us to handle everything, or—maybe you want support with just a few minor details. Some couples want direct involvement with the entire process, guided by Delilah as partners in coordinating the day together.*

*No matter what it is that you want for your special day, we will handle it. We're bespoke and flexible, the day is yours—not ours.*
